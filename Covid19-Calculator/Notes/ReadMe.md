### COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)
<hr>
The CORD-19 dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data mining to date. This allows the worldwide AI research community the opportunity to apply text and data mining approaches to find answers to questions within, and connect insights across, this content in support of the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts worldwide.

### Here’s a playbook for stopping deadly cytokine storm syndrome
``` 
 Perforin is a key weapon of the immune system’s cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. They use it to punch holes in the walls of infected, cancerous or otherwise undesirable cells... <br>
 Then they use these perforin channels to pour in toxic granzyme B, which induces the cells to self-destruct....

 Some 10% to 15% of the population may carry these mutations...

 Recently, cytokine storms also have been noted in patients treated with the new chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) as immunotherapy for cancer. “They see that in about 20% to 30% of cases,”...

 Cron and colleagues found evidence of perforin pathway-related mutations in five of the 14 samples they analyzed from patients who died in the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. More than 270,000 people were hospitalized and nearly 12,500 died in the H1N1 pandemic

 The doctors treated her with anakinra, a cytokine-targeting therapy that was approved to treat the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis.[ Turn around was immediate ]...

 The cells with perforin deficiencies “spent five times longer engaged” and released a flurry of cytokines, even though their lack of perforin made them incapable of destroying their target cell.

### Structure-Based Discovery of a Novel Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Inhibitor
```
Abstract
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered an important therapeutic target for controlling cardiovascular diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks. Recently solved high-resolution crystal structures of the apo-bound and inhibitor-bound forms of ACE2 have provided the basis for a novel molecular docking approach in an attempt to identify ACE2 inhibitors and compounds that block SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. In this study, ≈140 000 small molecules were screened by in silico molecular docking. In this structure-activity relation study, the molecules with the highest predicted binding scores were identified and assayed for ACE2 enzymatic inhibitory activity and for their ability to inhibit SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. This approach identified N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine as a novel ACE2 inhibitor that also is effective in blocking the SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. Thus, the molecular docking approach resulting in the inhibitory capacity of N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine provides an attractive small molecule lead compound on which the development of more effective therapeutic agents could be developed to modulate hypertension and for controlling SARS infections.

### A pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of human coronavirus spike  
<br>

``` 
Abstract
Continuously emerging highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) remain a major threat to human health, as illustrated in past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. The development of a drug with broad-spectrum HCoV inhibitory activity would address this urgent unmet medical need. Although previous studies have suggested that the HR1 of HCoV spike (S) protein is an important target site for inhibition against specific HCoVs, whether this conserved region could serve as a target for the development of broad-spectrum pan-CoV inhibitor remains controversial. Here, we found that peptide OC43-HR2P, derived from the HR2 domain of HCoV-OC43, exhibited broad fusion inhibitory activity against multiple HCoVs. EK1, the optimized form of OC43-HR2P, showed substantially improved pan-CoV fusion inhibitory activity and pharmaceutical properties. Crystal structures indicated that EK1 can form a stable six-helix bundle structure with both short α-HCoV and long β-HCoV HR1s, further supporting the role of HR1 region as a viable pan-CoV target site.

 Stop touching your eyes, mouth nose, Wash ones hands completely for at least 20 seconds. The Virus enters through the Eyes and the Mouth. 
 Epidemiologic data indicate that SARS-CoV is spread by respiratory droplets and contact. While such findings suggest that the virus enters the host through the mucosa of the respiratory tract and the eyes,
