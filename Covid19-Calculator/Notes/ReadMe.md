### Here’s a playbook for stopping deadly cytokine storm syndrome
``` 
 Perforin is a key weapon of the immune system’s cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. They use it to punch holes in the walls of infected, cancerous or otherwise undesirable cells... <br>
 Then they use these perforin channels to pour in toxic granzyme B, which induces the cells to self-destruct....

 Some 10% to 15% of the population may carry these mutations...

 Recently, cytokine storms also have been noted in patients treated with the new chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) as immunotherapy for cancer. “They see that in about 20% to 30% of cases,”...

 Cron and colleagues found evidence of perforin pathway-related mutations in five of the 14 samples they analyzed from patients who died in the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. More than 270,000 people were hospitalized and nearly 12,500 died in the H1N1 pandemic

 The doctors treated her with anakinra, a cytokine-targeting therapy that was approved to treat the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis.[ Turn around was immediate ]...

 The cells with perforin deficiencies “spent five times longer engaged” and released a flurry of cytokines, even though their lack of perforin made them incapable of destroying their target cell.

### ACE2 Receptor Expression and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Depend on Differentiation of Human Airway Epithelia
```
 Two previously recognized human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E) cause ∼30% of upper respiratory tract infections [1, 2]...

 Recently, two additional human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 [3] and HKU1 [4], were identified in association with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, respectively...

 Recently, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a receptor for both SARS-CoV (5) and NL63 (6)...

 ACE2 serves as the SARS-CoV receptor, at least for tissue culture cell entry...

 Lung tissue from such patients exhibits changes of diffuse alveolar damage, desquamated epithelial cells, type II cell hyperplasia, fibrin and collagen deposits in the alveolar space, increased mononuclear infiltrates in the interstitium, and, in some cases, the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells.

 Cardiac patients seem to be at higher risk in Covid-19. ...

 Cardiac patients seem to be at higher risk in Covid-19. One possible answer could be the following: Patients with the comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease might fulfil the indication for the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists...

 It has been shown that the Covid-19 agent (also known as SARS-CoV-2), uses the SARS-COV receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 for entry into target cells [4]....

 It could be shown in animal experiments that both the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin-receptor blocker losartan can significantly increase mRNA expression of cardiac ACE2 (5-fold and 3-fold, respectively) [5].

 Stop touching your eyes, mouth nose, Wash ones hands completely for at least 20 seconds. The Virus enters through the Eyes and the Mouth. 
 Epidemiologic data indicate that SARS-CoV is spread by respiratory droplets and contact. While such findings suggest that the virus enters the host through the mucosa of the respiratory tract and the eyes,
